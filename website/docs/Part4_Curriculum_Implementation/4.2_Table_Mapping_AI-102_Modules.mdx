# 4.2 Table: Mapping AI-102 Modules to Belgian Industries and Professional Roles

The strategic value of a training program is realized when its content directly maps to the specific needs of the local economy.

This mapping helps business leaders justify training investments by showing a direct line between a course module and a relevant business challenge or career development path. It transforms the curriculum from a generic technical offering into a strategic talent development plan tailored specifically for the Belgian economic landscape.
