# Lab 1.5: Writing a Preliminary Regulatory Compliance Statement

**Objective:** This lab is a written exercise designed to help you translate the legal and regulatory concepts from the EU AI Act and GDPR into a practical engineering mindset. You will apply your understanding to a high-stakes, realistic scenario.

**Scenario:** You are an AI Engineer working for a major Belgian bank. You have been assigned to the team developing the **"Real-Time Fraud Detector"** AI system, which will be a core part of the bank's digital transaction infrastructure. This system will analyze customer transactions in real-time and automatically block those it flags as potentially fraudulent.

Your project lead has asked you to prepare a **preliminary Regulatory Compliance Statement** to identify the legal challenges you will need to address during the project's design phase.

### Your Task

Based on the information provided in this module's `README.md`, write a brief compliance statement that addresses the following three points. There is no single "correct" answer; the goal is to demonstrate your ability to identify and reason about these regulatory issues.

**1. EU AI Act: Risk Classification**
   - What is the likely risk classification of the "Real-Time Fraud Detector" under the EU AI Act?
   - Provide a brief justification for your classification. (Hint: Consider the system's purpose and the sector in which it operates).

**2. EU AI Act: Obligations for High-Risk Systems**
   - Assuming the system is classified as high-risk, list at least four specific engineering or documentation obligations you will need to plan for during development.
   - For each obligation, write one sentence describing a practical step you might take to meet it. (e.g., For "Human Oversight," a practical step would be: "We will design a dashboard for bank staff to review and override flagged transactions.")

**3. GDPR: Data and Decision-Making Challenges**
   - Identify one potential challenge related to **training data** and GDPR.
   - Identify one potential challenge related to GDPR and the **automated decisions** the system will make about customers.

**2. Key Obligations for High-Risk Systems:**
   - **Obligation 1 (e.g., Human Oversight):** *[Your practical step here]*
   - **Obligation 2 (e.g., Technical Documentation):** *[Your practical step here]*
   - **Obligation 3 (e.g., Data Governance):** *[Your practical step here]*
   - **Obligation 4 (e.g., Transparency):** *[Your practical step here]*

**3. Foreseen GDPR Challenges:**
   - **Training Data Challenge:** *[Your identified challenge here]*
   - **Automated Decision-Making Challenge:** *[Your identified challenge here]*


*(This lab does not require you to write code. It is designed to prepare you for the mandatory "Regulatory Compliance Statement" you will need to write for the capstone project in Module 6.)*
